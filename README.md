# runit

This repository holds the version of runit that is used by Saux Linux. It incorporates patches that fix issues found by users as well as certain compiler warnings.

The source was obtained from http://smarden.org/runit/runit-2.1.2.tar.gz.

The objective of this repository is not to revamp the runit code completely or add functionality that detracts from its simplicity, but rather to provide a canonical version of the source code and to avoid the inclusion of patches in saux ports.
